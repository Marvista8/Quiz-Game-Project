# Quiz-Game-Project

## Scenario
As a Boot Camp Instructor. I wish to creat a timed quiz on CSS fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my student's progress compared to their peers.

## Functionality: 
-   A student begins to take  the test
-   Then they click a start button to begin the test.
-   Then  a timer starts and they presented with a question
-   When they answer a question incorrectly
-   If they guess correctly then they will get points.
-   The quiz is over
-   They are then given the option to save their information to join the leaderboard.git
